# MVVM-project-using-Android-Jetpack
ONGOING project: this is a CRUD app started from a Codelab, that I have decided to develop further to integrate all the latest Android Jetpack libraries + Retrofit for network calls, and MVVM architecture.

I am currently working on the integration of HILT (dependency injection) aiming to write UI testing (Espresso)
in the most efficient way possible.

Other things I am considering:
1)  Create a fragment (first page) to login -> using (a) Firebase auth or (b) biometric authentication
2) Add a local storage (via Room database) for the News page (NewsFragment) where to store locally the first n. amount of articles,
to show in case internet is down.
